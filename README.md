The provided code is designed to analyze email headers and print the extracted information such as the subject, sender, receiver, and date. When you run the code and provide a valid email file path, it will output the extracted information.

For example, if you have an email file named "sample_email.eml" and you replace "/path/to/email.eml" with the actual path to this file:

```python
email_file_path = "path/to/sample_email.eml"
```

When you run the code, it will read the email file, extract the relevant information from the headers, and print the output similar to the following:

```
Subject: Example Email Subject
Sender: John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
Receiver: Jane Smith <janesmith@example.com>
Date: Mon, 01 Jan 2023 12:34:56 +0000
```

The output will vary depending on the content of the email file you provide.

Please note that this code focuses on email header analysis only. If you require more advanced email forensics, such as analyzing email content, attachments, or performing deeper analysis, you may need to incorporate additional libraries or tools specific to your requirements.
